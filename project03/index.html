    <div><h2>Vietnam Veterans Throughout the United States</h2></div>
    <p>The approximate percentage of Vietnam-era veterans who are still alive in 2013 is 75. Some online estimates suggest that the number is much more stark: Only one-third of Vietnam veterans are still alive, these Web sites say, and the survivors are going fast.</p>

    <p>In reality, the death rate for Vietnam-era veterans in recent years has been comparable to or lower than that of other men in their age group, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the men with the age distribution of Vietnam-era veterans who were alive in 2000, about 12 percent had died by 2010, with about 1.5 percent of the survivors projected to die each year since then.</p>
