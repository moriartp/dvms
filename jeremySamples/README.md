#Getting started with Javascript

##Tools & Libraries

####Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

####npm
Node's package manager is built into the node install. You can make sure you’ve got the very most recent version of npm using npm itself:
	
	sudo npm install npm -g

#### Simple Node server

####live-server
This is a little development server with live reload capability. Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site. Install:
